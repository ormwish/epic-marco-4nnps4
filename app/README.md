> The product aims to solve the problem of creating a sliding overlay with a grid of embedded websites (iframes) and enabling communication between the parent window and the iframes. Additionally, it preserves the results of interactions in [IndexedDB], a client-side storage solution.

**The product offers the following features:**

- A *sliding overlay* that can be toggled on and off, providing a space to display the grid of embedded websites.
- A grid layout that organizes the *embedded websites* (iframes) in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate manner.
- Communication between the parent window and the iframes using the `window.postMessage` API, allowing for interaction with the embedded websites programmatically.
- Preservation of interaction results in IndexedDB, ensuring that data is stored and can be retrieved later.

This solution is particularly useful for users who want to create a custom interface for interacting with multiple websites simultaneously, while also storing the results of those interactions for future reference.
